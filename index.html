<p>This matrix clarifies service boundaries and helps organisations select the appropriate engagement model based on internal capabilities and risk tolerance. Advisory engagements suit teams with strong technical resources who need strategic guidance and validation. Managed services provide complete operational responsibility, ideal for organisations prioritising focus on core business activities.</p>
<p>Co-managed models balance control and expertise, allowing internal teams to maintain hands-on involvement whilst benefiting from specialist knowledge and 24/7 coverage. Shared responsibilities are clearly defined through service level agreements that specify escalation procedures, communication protocols, and performance metrics.</p>
<p>The flexibility to transition between engagement models ensures that services evolve with organisational maturity and changing requirements. Many clients begin with advisory services during initial security programme development, then transition to managed or co-managed models as operations scale.</p>
